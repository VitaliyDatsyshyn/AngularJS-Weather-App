To work correctly, this application should be open through lo—Åalhost. For example, I use IDE PHPStorm and http://localhost:63342/PROJECT_NAME/ is PhpStorm's own simple built-in web server in action. It is used if no Deployment entries are defined (or defined but non of them is marked as default for this project).
When you use Open in Browser action IDE checks your deployment settings looking for base URL that will be used to open such file in a browser. If it finds no such entries then instead of opening this file using file:// protocol it uses its' own built-in web server.
